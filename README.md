Introduction
JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is executed in the browser and can also be used for server-side development with frameworks like Node.js.

Variables
Variables store data that can be used and manipulated in a program.

Key Points:
Declaring variables:
let – block-scoped, preferred for variables that may change.
const – block-scoped, used for constants (cannot be reassigned).
var – function-scoped, outdated, and less commonly used.
Example:
